In a visually sumptuous journey through the master‚Äôs imagination, tales of childlike wonder give way to apocalyptic apparitions: a young boy stumbles on a fox wedding in a forest; a soldier confronts the ghosts of the war dead; a power plant meltdown smothers a seaside landscape in radioactive fumes. Interspersed with reflections on the redemptive power of creation, including a richly textured tribute to Vincent van Gogh (who is played by Martin Scorsese), Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs Dreams is both a showcase for its maker‚Äôs artistry at its most unbridled and a deeply personal lament for a world at the mercy of human ignorance.","viewCount":87811,"lengthSeconds":7174,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1715746356071,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"zpZYGOwVgacOi3hT","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}
